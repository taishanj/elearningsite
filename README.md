This e-learning website project was started on the 24th September 2019. After originally attempting to use LMS system on wordpress as well as following a 5:00 hour tutorial by wP Crafter (https://youtu.be/P1ippRa65Og). The tutorial required spending upwards of 300USD to complete. After successfully avoiding most of the fees: web hosting,SSL certificates, LMS system versions and packages I ran into the problems with the free version of the plugin. It would not allow key changes for example: adding MCQ Questions and randomizing questions and answers. These seemed like bugs in their software as opposed to intentional design restrictions. At this point I decided to go for a more custom built option.


This website is designed with the intention of providing Udemy, Coursera like self learning environment and tools. Specifically, video content that is categorized by field and sub topics as well as assessment material to determine users mastery of the subject material. There are additional features that will add greater user experience and efficacy of content delivery however they are as yet to be implemented.

The current project is able to handle (basically) the following:
New user registration
Login/Logout 
Display user dashboard
Display library/menu of available content/courses from MySQL Database
Update user progress to database (click counter using jquery AJAX). This feature is far from complete but provides a basic framework for achieving the task.

Features that are next to be added and critical to mvp (minimally viable prodcut) are: (Target Delivery date: 14th Sept 2019)
Secure (Login)/Email Confirmation and validation i.e. @g*iel.com not permitted
Email contact directly from website
Student progress bar
Side bar menu with Subject categories (History- Egyptian civilization, Mayan civilization etc)
Quizzes/Evaluations that load when user selects a category
Uploadable profile pic/image
User friendly course upload UI- Subject, topic name, video (Youtube,Vimeo) link, Mulitple choice questions input, Timeframe for completion specification
